                    <p class="post-meta">Posted by <a href="index.html">CampusFly</a> February 1st 2015</p>

                    <p> First, I would like to begin by saying that there was not a single moment where the light bulb went off and instantly CampusFly was born. Rather, it was a series of realizations and frustrations that ultimately led to what we have created. I noticed that on our campus, outside event planners or promoters were relying primarily on Facebook to reach out to college students. The process that they usually followed was first befriend a current student in the school that they were trying to infiltrate, and use that student as an “ambassador” to invite their peers to the events using Facebook. These ambassadors usually got paid or kept a percentage of what they sold, making it worth for them to actually do this kind of job. </p> 

                    <p> I also saw student organizations who put together incredible events on campus, but did not have an online venue to sell tickets. On my campus, you had to purchase your tickets for events in a brick and mortar location in the center of campus; not the worst thing ever, but it’s certainly an inconvenience and relatively archaic for people my age. We have all been used to buying tickets online, but for some reason our college had not caught up with new technologies. The thing that really pushed me to pursue CampusFly was when I attended Start-Up Weekend Rochester in 2014. I was one of maybe 6 college students there out of a crowd of over a 100 people. A lot of the people there were in their late 20s and early 30s, many even older. For those who might not know, Start-Up weekend is an event where people interested in starting a business come together over the course of one long, sleepless weekend to try and create their business and pitch it. The event usually attracts young and talented engineers, and in a place like Rochester with top notch engineering schools at University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology, one would expect a ton of aspiring entrepreneurs or talented programmers to be at this type of event, but, sadly, that was not the case. </p>

                    <p> So, I came back to campus and discovered that other students just were not aware that this event was going on, and a lot of them were upset that they had missed it. But, of course, we all know that feeling way too well. The feeling when you find out that there was a cool event that you missed because you just didn’t know about it, or the frustration you feel when you want to make plans to do something fun this weekend but you have to search 5 different websites to find out what’s going on, and on top of that you have to do a google map search to find out how far from campus those events are. We understand those feelings, we’re students too. So, we have been working tirelessly for almost a whole year to create something that made college a little easier. Something that student organization and event planners could use to share their event with their entire campus; something that students could use to easily find what’s going on around them and what their peers are doing without wasting hours of valuable time. We came up with CampusFly. We can’t wait to launch and share our product with you. Stay tuned, and follow us on our social media for news, updates, and cool giveaways! </p>
