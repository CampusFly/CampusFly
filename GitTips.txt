Basic Comments on Using Git:

1) Git init: - will set up git on one of your local files
2) git pull URL: -will allow you to pull files from the given repo URL to your git repository
3) git add file: will add your given file to the waiting list (I forget what this is called)-- it is an intermediar section before fully committing your files to the main branch or live repo

4) git commit: will add the files in your intermediary section to the repo speciied.

5) git status: will aloow you yo see status of your code

6) git push will push you repo to the live


----------------------------------------------------------------
Warning:
1) do not edit directly on origin/master. We will be able to see that you made the changes and messed everything up, so you do not want to be blamed
2) always fork you your own repo or make a branch

---------------------------------------------------------------
Tips for debugging:
1) git log: will allow you to see the log of changes made to the given branch
2) git checkout id: will allow you to see the files in the state of the checked-out time period to determine if bug existed that that point
3) git checkout master: will take you back to the original most recent issue
4) git diff item1 item2: will allow you to compare two items and see what was added and removed


I will ad more tips and commands that may help as time permits and issues arise
